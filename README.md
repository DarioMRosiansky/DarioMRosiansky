# Hi, I'm Darius! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Frontend developer...

My name is Darío, I am 44 years old, I am hard of hearing and I use hearing aids with which I do not have a mild hearing loss. Currently, I stopped working in the freight business, a task that I have carried out for the last 7 years to dedicate myself full time to fulfill my long-standing dream, which was to dedicate myself to programming. I am a very responsible person with a great capacity for learning, critical analysis and creative resolution of complex problems. I want to emphasize that I like to work in a team, cooperating with everyone and helping in the best possible way and I feel great satisfaction teaching and learning at the same time. I am looking for my first experience as a Jr. Developer, trainee or intern.
